        <h2>Removing some stuff</h2>
        <p>$ rm -rf meta all</p>

        <h2>Intro -monopoly products</h2>
        <p>Monopoly is good, but only if you are on the side of the monopoly, not on the customer/product side.</p>
        
        <!--<h2>Similar to Facebook monetization</h2>-->
        <h2>Every new update changes the original product!</h2>
        <p>WhatsApp was originally created as a simple messaging app, but it has gradually been transformed into a social media platform. This has led to many users feeling alienated from the app, as they no longer recognize it as the product they signed up for.</p>
        <p>For example, the recent introduction of channel features and communities has been met with backlash from many users, who argue that it has turned WhatsApp into a clone of other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p><strong>Selling APIs to businesses, which will eventually result in spamming my WhatsApp, and I detest irrelevant things in my inbox. Indirectly, I will become a victim of ads and the Mere-Exposure Effect.</strong></p><br>
        <p>WhatsApp has started selling APIs to businesses, which will allow them to send messages to users directly. This is likely to lead to an increase in spam messages on the platform.</p>
        <p>The Mere-Exposure Effect is a psychological phenomenon in which people become more likely to like something the more they are exposed to it. This means that even if you initially dislike seeing ads on WhatsApp, you may eventually become more accepting of them if you are exposed to them often enough.</p>
    
        <br>
        <p><strong>The newly added channel feature and communities. The communities and following channels are nothing less than a social media site. I'm sorry to say that my ideas do not align with pointless discussions, and I have no interest in sharing my mobile number with anybody at any cost.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>As mentioned above, the introduction of channel features and communities has turned WhatsApp into a more social media-like platform. This may appeal to some users, but it has alienated others who prefer WhatsApp to remain a simple messaging app.</p>
    
        <br>
        <p><strong>The WhatsApp status feature. I have no patience for people sharing foolish things. I have often heard people discussing nonsense, and I can't listen to something that doesn't make sense. I have frequently seen and heard people talking about irrelevant things, and they came to know about it from nowhere but one of Meta's products.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The WhatsApp status feature allows users to share text, photos, and videos with their contacts. While this can be a fun way to stay in touch with friends and family, it can also be used to share irrelevant and foolish content.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the status feature can be used to spread misinformation and propaganda or whatever but that is not what I expected from messaging app. they made it engaging app than just instang messaging app.</p>
    
        <br>
        <p><strong>Big Brother can keep an eye on you. It is not uncommon for corporations to share data with government agencies. Data is now more valuable than crude oil.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>This is something for which I would like to keep my opinion personal</p>
        <!--<p>WhatsApp is owned by Meta, which is a data-hungry corporation. Meta has a history of collecting and sharing user data with third parties, including government agencies.</p>
        <p>This means that your WhatsApp communications could be monitored by government agencies, even if you have nothing to hide.</p>-->
    
        <br>
        <p><strong>WhatsApp has started making its mark in every corner of the world, and now that they have introduced channel features, it has become even easier to spread nonsense, propaganda, political views, and soon, ads.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>WhatsApp is now the most popular messaging app in the world, with over 2 billion active users. This gives Meta a huge platform to spread propaganda and misinformation.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the introduction of channel features has made it easier for people to create and join groups that spread harmful content.</p>
    
        <br>
        <p><strong>Unlike other social media sites, WhatsApp is even more serious because there's no anonymity on WhatsApp. This was acceptable when it was just a messenger app, but now that it has introduced channel features, it has surpassed all others.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike other social media platforms, WhatsApp does not allow users to create anonymous accounts. This means that users are more likely to be held accountable for what they say on the platform.</p>
        <p>However, this also means that users are more likely to be targeted by censorship and surveillance.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Monetization and greed is not bad, but</h2>
        <p>Monetization is not inherently bad; that's how business works, and that's often when VCs will invest. Facebook's monetization, however, makes me their product, and I receive no returns. It's a monopoly, and a monopoly is not necessarily bad. In fact, if possible, I would love to invest in monopoly businesses only, and I may or may not care if it makes people victims of their products. But I can't let these products make me their victim.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Thank you for reading this.</p>
