        <h1>Fly Too Close to the Sun</h1>
        <p>Fri Sept 29 2023</p>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The myth of Icarus is one of the oldest and most famous Greek myths. It has been told and retold for centuries and has been featured in countless works of art, literature, and music.</p>

        <h2>The story of Icarus</h2>
        <p>Icarus was the son of Daedalus, a skilled craftsman and inventor. He built two pairs of wings out of feathers and wax. He warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or too close to the sea but to follow his flight path.</p>

        <p>The possible reasons why Icarus decided to fly higher and higher.</p>

        <h2>What did Icarus hope to achieve by flying higher?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Hubris</h4>
                <p>This is something foolish, and I don't think it was right at all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Ambition</h4>
                <p>Icarus may have been ambitious to the point of recklessness. He may have wanted to fly higher than anyone else had ever flown before, even if it meant putting himself in danger.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Curiosity</h4>
                <p>Icarus may have been simply curious about what it would be like to fly as close to the sun as possible. He may have wanted to see the world from a different perspective and experience the thrill of flying higher than anyone else had ever dared to fly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Youthful exuberance</h4>
                <p>Icarus was a young man, and young people are often impulsive and reckless. He may have been so excited about the experience of flying that he forgot about the dangers involved.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Temptation</h4>
                <p>The sun is a powerful and alluring symbol. It is the source of life and light, and it can be very tempting to get closer to it. Icarus may have been tempted by the sun's beauty and power, even though he knew it was dangerous and fatal.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Icarus in the Pi Movie:</h2>
        <p>Max Cohen, a brilliant and intuitive mathematician, believes that in nature, there is a Regulatory Principle based on mathematical laws. He is certain that Mathematical Order is ubiquitous and endeavors to explore it through the study of stock market trends.</p>

        <h4>He restates his assumptions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mathematics is the language of nature.</li>
            <li>Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.</li>
            <li>If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in nature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What the movie tells</h4>
        <p>When Max is playing Go with his mentor, Sol Robeson, Sol, after observing Max's pursuit, warns him that he has named his fish 'Icarus' after him. Towards the end of the movie, we witness Max attempting to surpass his limits but ultimately failing, leading him to decide to abandon his pursuit.</p>

        <h2>What the story tells us</h2>
        <p>
            <h4>We are all mortal and have limitations in our knowledge and understanding:</h4>
            No matter how much we expand our knowledge, there will always be areas where our understanding falls short. However, anyone attempting to challenge these limits will face consequences for their actions.
        </p>

        <h2>My perspective diverges from the traditional morals of the story:</h2>
        <p>Consider this</p>
        <p>Did Icarus not realize that his fervent desire to ascend to the Sun would ultimately lead him towards his demise? Yet, Icarus chose to soar to great heights. We all understand that our days on this earth are limited, but opting to embrace that finite existence while striving for the extraordinary, against all odds, is what makes Icarus my hero.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My viewpoint can be succinctly captured by a single question: "If Icarus hadn't harbored such ambition, if Icarus hadn't dared to shatter the confines of convention, would we be discussing Icarus's legacy today?"</li>
            <li>To me, Icarus epitomizes not recklessness but valor and ambition. Icarus's enduring legacy had granted Icarus immortality, ensuring that every time someone recounts the tale of Icarus, Icarus becomes alive.</li>
        </ul>
