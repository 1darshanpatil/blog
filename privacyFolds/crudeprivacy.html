  <h1>Outsmart the Smartphone using iOS</h1>

  <div class="container">



    <div class="privacy-section">
      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>I don't view them as smartphones; I consider them over-smartphones.</strong> Thankfully, I've been
          using the internet since I was 12, so I've observed the drastic changes it has undergone. The internet has
          essentially become a dead space. For instance, if I want to find out if a MacBook is a good purchase, I find
          it more useful to search for 'Why MacBooks suck.' It may not be straightforward, but it helps me navigate the
          manipulative nature of the internet.</p>
        <p><strong>I prefer to maintain a high level of privacy, particularly when it comes to my personal
            life:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Phone Usage:</strong> I use my phone for only the most basic needs. I may use the Safari browser, but
          even that has a time limit.</p>
        <p><strong>Music:</strong> I listen to music, but the songs are downloaded onto my devices; I don't rely on the
          internet or any apps for this.</p>
        <p><strong>Banking:</strong> Given my finance background, I understand how banking works. I prefer to use cash
          for transactions, especially for local shopping.</p>
        <p><strong>SMS:</strong> I prefer text messages over calls or emails. However, my SMS app doesn't have
          notifications enabled; it only shows a badge.</p>
        <p><strong>Calls:</strong> I purchased the 'CEO' ringtone from iTunes and have no intention of changing it in
          the future. I bought it because iPhones have restrictions on setting ringtones, and I wanted something boring
          yet professional in case it rings during a meeting.</p>
        <p><strong>Screen Time:</strong> My daily phone screen time doesn't exceed 2 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> I don't shop from my phone; for that, I use a tablet and access the desktop
          version of websites instead of apps.</p>
        <p><strong>Emails:</strong> I don't have email set up on my iPhone.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Media:</strong> I have a firm 'no' policy for social media on my phone.</p>

        <h2>Apps on My iPhone</h2>
        <p><a href="./iphoneSnaps/background-stalking.PNG" target="_blank" class="hlink">Didn't you ever wonder why they
            say Install the app right now!</a></p>
        <p>Privacy begins with minimizing the number of apps used, as apps are a major source of privacy threats.</p>
        <p><strong>How companies trick people ending up sharing data:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pre-checking boxes that grant data access during installation or onboarding.</li>
          <li>Placing the 'Agree' or 'Accept' buttons in more prominent positions than the 'Decline' or 'Opt-Out'
            buttons.</li>
          <li>Concealing important details in footnotes or using small fonts.</li>
          <li>Getting access to Contacts, Phone logs, Location, Media, and others although the app may not need it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Keep it clean</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>I only keep apps that I use at least once a week.</li>
          <li>I have removed almost all default apps provided by Apple(Including iMusic, iTunes, TV, and many more);
            thank you Apple, for making it easier unlike Android phones.</li>
          <li>Exceptions include a few apps that require extra setup time, possibly for authentication or security
            reasons; for example, banking apps that require verification.</li>
          <li>Social media apps? Nah, not on my phone.</li>
          <li><strong>I do not want banks to track my expenses or know my preferencesðŸ™‚</strong> I usually have cash on
            me, but if I have to go digital, it's with an official bank app. No third-party stuff.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cellular Data</h2>
        <p>Data is important, so why would we allow apps to track us around the clock?</p>
        <p>I see no reason why apps should have internet access when we are not using them.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are some tips for protecting your data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read privacy policies carefully before granting any app access to your data. (At least skim through them.)
          </li>
          <li>Only grant apps access to the data they require to function.</li>
          <li>Regularly review the permissions you have granted to apps and revoke any that are no longer needed.</li>
          <li>I use nothing but the Safari browser, with cookies turned off. <a href="./iphoneSnaps/safari.PNG"
              target="_blank" class="hlink">Learn more</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The most important thing you can do to protect your data is to disable cellular data access for apps
            when you are not using them. This prevents background tracking.</strong></p>

        <h3>How Your Data Can Be Used</h3>
        <p>Assume I am your banking app. I know where you spend your money because transactions are linked to your
          identity. I know where you live and can gather information about that locality from other devices to
          understand your social status and spending ability.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/" target="_blank" class="hlink">Social
              Media:</a></strong> Believe it or not, these platforms know more about you than you may realize. Try an
          experiment: stalk a few people on, say, Facebook, and ask a friend to let you look at their YouTube account.
          You'll find out a lot about their interests, political views, and almost everything about their personality.
          <a href="./iphoneSnaps/youtube.png" target="_blank" class="hlink">My YouTube Account</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microtargeting Voters:</strong> Political campaigns can use location and usage data to microtarget
            voters with ads and messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Location-based Ads:</strong> Apps with access to your location can track your movements and show
            you targeted ads based on your location.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage-based Ads:</strong> Apps can track your usage habits and show you targeted ads based on your
            activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Selling Your Data to Third Parties:</strong> Companies can sell your location and usage data to
            third parties, such as advertisers, data brokers, and other companies. If they are selling this data, they
            will always want more.</li>
        </ul>

        <a href="./iphoneSnaps/cellular-access.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="./iphoneSnaps/cellular-access.PNG"
            alt="Apps with cellular access"></a>
        <p class="caption">ðŸ¤” No, no, no. Apps definitely don't need access to the internet 24/7. That would be
          ridiculous. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¢
          <br>
          In conclusion, why grant internet access to apps when you're not using them? Why not enable access only when
          you intend to use them?

    <!-- Duck Notifications -->
    <div class="privacy-section">
      <div class="description">
        <h2>They Don't Need Notification Access</h2>
        <p>Why are e-commerce, bank apps, and social media always in a rush for notification access?</p>

        <p><strong>The Role of Notifications and Why You Should Restrict App Access</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Banks:</strong> Most banks, at least my bank, try to lure me in for credit cards. For me, a credit
            card is a dangerous chip :)</li>
          <li><strong>E-commerce Sites:</strong> They're always trying to give you FOMO with phrases like "Hurry up! Buy
            now!" and emojis that grab your attention ðŸ˜²ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> They take up unconscious space in your brain; it's like they're indirectly
            showing you ads.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="screenshot">

            alt="Why notifications are naughty"></a>
        <p class="caption">By birth I got no patience for stupidity! And an irrelevant notification to me is nothing but
          a stupid psychological hack tried by developers. To me, it's like, "Hey, Darshan! Look at this thing that has
          nothing to do with you! Click on it! Click on it!" It's nothing less than stupid.</p>

            know.</li>
          <li><strong>Microphone: </strong>WhatsApp needs my mic 'cause I'm always on international calls. But once I
            hang up, that access is gone. Bye!</li>
          <li><strong>Phone Logs: </strong>Truecaller wants in? Sure, it's cool, but I'm not stressing over calls. If
            you're not in my contacts, my phone stays silent. I'll look you up later.</li>
          <li><strong>SMS: </strong>Some apps beg for SMS access, but I'm like, "No way, Jose."</li>

        <h2>Apple's Connection to Gravity, but Not to Siri</h2>
        <p>I've found that Apple is far superior to Android's APK offerings. Believe it or not, I avoid using Google
