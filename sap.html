            It's important to distinguish between the general term "humans" and the technical, Latin designation "Homo
            sapiens." When using "Homo sapiens," I specifically refer to the scientific classification of our species,
            as
            defined by Linnaeus
        </p>

            Yesterday, before going to bed, I tried to explain psychology to someone I know. As always, although she
            shows interest, she lacked curiosity. While telling her, I felt curious and started watching videos about
            "Body Language," from which I learned something fascinating from Stanford students.
        </p>

        <p>
            After that, I somehow ended up, thanks to location-based YouTube suggestions, watching videos about how
            religions other than H-ism handle cows, how H-ism in Nepal sacrifice buffaloes, and a few cases of human
            sacrifices in I-country. Following that, I discovered how, in the B-ism religion, before proselytization,
            makes people vow, "I shall not have any faith in Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, and I won't worship them."
            Basically, this is something people in the H-ism religion may find hard to tolerate. Moreover, it indicates
            that people in B-ism do not believe in H-ism gods. Essentially, this might pose challenges for those in
            the H-religion. Furthermore, it signifies a divergence between B-ism and the belief in H-ism's gods,
            potentially laying the groundwork for future conflicts that others may exploit. Unaware of these facts, I
            found myself leaning towards B-ism. It wasn't a strict adherence to the religion, but rather a
            recognition that the peace taught by Buddha undeniably holds positive implications for mankind.
            (I would like to add that out of curiosity, I have also read about Judaism, Islam, Japan's Shintoism,
            Christianity, Jain-Darsha, and obviously Hinduism.)

        </p>
        <p> As already mentioned, I used to believe in the existence of God. However, witnessing the division among
            people has led me to abandon that belief entirely. Despite, I identify myself as an atheist, I strongly
            acknowledge the existence of a supreme being who set the planets into motion. It's important to note that,
            for the existence of life, I express gratitude to sunlight, and at times, I may not hesitate to refer to it
            as "god." However, my definition of god revolves around the concept of flourishing and life on Earth.</p>

        <p>
        <p>
            Speaking of Earth, it reminds me of Giordano Bruno, Galileo Galilei's conflicts with Christianity, and
            Isaac Newton's conflicts with Trinity and Christianity. I also would like to add that religions can turn
            into terror, as seen in the historical pages where Jews and the Hitler government clashed. That must be the
            blood-stained history. Basically, bigotry and hatred seem to have their roots in religious conflicts, not in
            the people themselves, but those who try to rule use these religious tactics to gain power.

        </p>
        <p>
            As I have learned a lot from the qualities of Lord Ram, which I prefer to call him as "Purushottam," meaning
            a man who is perfect in all senses (Uttam asa Purush); a perfect husband who always remained loyal to his
            wife, a perfect son who sacrificed everything on his parents' wishes, and Lord Krishna (who is nothing but
            an ideal figure â€“ not only kind but also very intelligent, possessing knowledge spanning from history to the
            present, and being rich yet down-to-earth for everyone). So, I have gained these insights because of my
            Hindu faith. Whether these stories are mythical or real, I would not choose to delve into that investigation
            as my primary interest lies in the reasoninig that can be proved by facts or at least could be predicted by
            mathematics, but these narratives motivate me to be kind, thirst for knowledge, exhibit humility, and embody
            the qualities that a person should have to be considered "Purushottam."

        </p>
        <p>
            No doubt, I am thankful to be born into the Hindu faith; however, I would like to identify myself as a "Homo
            sapiens." as, For me, religion and science are like two sides of the same coin. However, my interpretation
            differs from the conventional understanding. When I refer to "two sides of the same coin," I mean that these
            are distinct aspects, and finding a harmonious balance between them can be challenging. It's worth noting
            that my perspective doesn't dismiss the ability of others to seamlessly integrate a strong faith in both God
            and the principles of science, reason, or mathematics, as demonstrated by the exemplary case of S.
            Ramanujan. I prefer not to participate in activities that contribute to division or are susceptible to exploitation for the purpose of dividing and ruling. I strongly believe that the happiness
            and growth of mankind should be the top priority, stemming from science and knowledge.
            In essence, if my thought process doesn't align with my surroundings, it is likely that it's not the place I
            want to be.

        </p>
        Each day, I find myself increasingly impatient and succumbing to burnout due to the pervasive foolishness in
        my surroundings. Noise pollution, environmental harm caused by fireworks, the rising cost of education, and
        the excessive influence of mobile internet on people's minds prompt me to contemplate what its end will be.
        Amidst these challenges, I am conscious of the fact that somewhere on this same planet, individuals are
        deeply immersed in meaningful research, sacrificing their happiness and life for the pursuit of knowledge.
        There are those tirelessly working akin to Sir Isaac Newton, individuals dedicated to solitude while solving
        millennium prize problems, and others in positions of power and wealth enjoying lives filled with happiness.
        </p>

        <p>

            I am keenly aware of how those in authority may mock the general populace for their perceived foolishness in
            electing them, and how individuals in hedge funds prioritize profit over everything else. Simultaneously, I
            observe the relentless expansion of businesses, while on the flip side, some struggle to afford even basic
            necessities, facing poverty, hunger, and a lack of access to education. The juxtaposition of people making
            fortunes in the health sector with others unable to afford essential healthcare is particularly striking.

        </p>


        <p> The dynamics of capitalism, in best case scenarios may offer opportunities for poor with great ideas to be wealthy, also perpetuate a form of
            enslavement for those without financial means. The question arises: how probable is success for someone who
            couldn't even afford their education in a system driven by economic disparities?
        </p>


        <p>
            Despite all this, I hold respect for the "Tiranga." I've made sure to educate myself about the history of
            the Tiranga and how it should be treated, but it seems like nobody cares. The Constitution, in practice, has
            become as useless to people as land to an owner who doesn't know if he truly owns it and lives in a rented
            house.
            For instance, the education system fails to teach (I'm referring to the education system) and lacks in
            spreading awareness among people about their fundamental rights. as, legislation, jurisdiction, government,
            and the fourth pillar is used by the government to promote its propaganda. In such a scenario, how will it
            be possible for anyone to claim their rights as outlined in the holy constitution? The question then arises:
            Who benefits from these rights? It's often those in power who have the time to understand everything,
            leaving people in poverty at a disadvantage. This also reminds me of <a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/gquots1.htm">Gandhiji's talisman</a>: "Will my decision
            help the hunger of millions of people starving out there?"
